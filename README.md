## About

_**Archey**_ is traditionally a _**Linux**_ tool for displaying system info in a pretty way on _**Arch Linux**_. It was originally written in _**Python 2**_ and then rewriten in _**Python 3**_. _**Archey-go**_ is written from scratch in _**[Go](https://golang.org)**_ and it compiles to a single statically linked binary. It's fast, it has no external dependencies and doesn't call any system utilities to gather the information. It also allows a decent amount of customization to satisfy your _**[unixporn](https://www.reddit.com/r/unixporn)**_ addiction.

## Installing

To install _**Archey-go**_ you must have _**Go**_ [installed](https://golang.org/doc/install) and set up to be able to compile it first.

On Arch Linux you can install _**Go**_ with ```pacman -S go go-tools```.

Clone the repository and build it.
```
git clone git@github.com:alexdreptu/archey-go.git
cd archey-go
go build
```
The result is a binary called _**archey-go**_ that you can move wherever you want afterwards.

Alternatively you can install _**Archey-go**_ via go tooling.

You need to export ```$GOPATH``` and ```$GOBIN``` then add ```$GOBIN``` to ```$PATH```

E.g. if you're using bash add to ~/.bashrc
```
export GOPATH=$HOME/.gocode
export GOBIN=$GOPATH/bin
export PATH+=:$GOBIN
```
where _**.gocode**_ can be replaced with any directory name. Then ```source ~/.bashrc```.

Assuming you have that set up, you install _**Archey-go**_ by executing
```
go get github.com/alexdreptu/archey-go
```

**NOTE:** From [Go 1.8](https://beta.golang.org/doc/go1.8) onwards you don't need to manually set ```$GOPATH``` and ```$GOBIN```. ```$GOPATH``` automatically [defaults](https://beta.golang.org/doc/go1.8#gopath) to ```$HOME/go```.

The **_archey-go_** binary will be located in ```$GOBIN```
```
alectic@particular $ echo $GOBIN
/home/alectic/.gocode/bin
alectic@particular $ which archey-go
/home/alectic/.gocode/bin/archey-go
alectic@particular $
```

## Usage

_**Archey-go**_ can be used with or without a config file. The configuration file format is _**[toml](https://github.com/toml-lang/toml)**_. Each flag responsible for configuration has an equivalent variable in its configuration file. See _**[sample_config.toml](https://github.com/alexdreptu/archey-go/blob/master/sample_config.toml)**_.

**NOTE:** _**Archey-go**_ doesn't include an option to take a screenshot, as I think this shouldn't be handled by _**Archey-go**_. Instead you can use _**scrot**_. If you just want to take a screenshot of the terminal window, you ```scrot -s -q 100 screenshot1.png``` after which you click on the terminal window. The next window you click your mouse pointer on after you run the command, will be screenshotted. For convenience run it from a command runner, usually set to ```alt+F2``` or directly from the terminal window in which _**Archey-go**_ was executed. Otherwise without ```-s``` or with a counter ```-cd 5``` to screenshot the whole display after 5 seconds.

To install _**scrot**_ you ```pacman -S scrot```.

--config
```
Specify config file. The configuration file is optional, _**archey-go**_ can be configured via flags. By default _**archey-go**_ looks first in the current directory for _**config.toml**_, if it's not there then it looks for ```$HOME/.archey-go/config.toml``` or ```$HOME/.config/archey-go/config.toml``` in this order. If neither one of them is there, it looks for ```/etc/archey-go/config.toml```.
